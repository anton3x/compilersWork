# Compilers Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Compilers project, a practical exercise split into three parts designed for the 1st semester of the 2nd year of Computer Engineering. This project focuses on developing a set of regular expressions and finite automata to enable communication with an autonomous electric vehicle in the Compiling&Building factory.

## Part 1 - Practical Work
### Assignment Details:

- **Objective:**
  Develop a set of regular expressions and equivalent finite automata for a set of instructions used to communicate with the autonomous vehicle.

- **Instructions:**
  1. **MAINTENANCE(V):** Instructs the vehicle to go to the maintenance station.
  2. **CHARGE-BATTERY(V):** Instructs the vehicle to go to the charging station.
  3. **DELIVERY(L,M,Q):** Instructs the vehicle to make a delivery on an assembly line.
  4. **PICKUP(LIST):** Instructs the vehicle to pick up materials from the warehouse.
  5. **STATUS(I):** Instructs the vehicle to communicate its current state.

## Part 2 - Practical Work
### Assignment Details:

- **Objective:**
  Design a lexical analyzer using LEX/FLEX for the set of instructions related to the autonomous vehicle.

- **Tasks:**
  1. Identify a set of instructions for communication with the vehicle.
  2. Trigger corresponding actions for each instruction, updating and printing the vehicle's state.
  3. Validate irregular situations and raise alerts when they occur.
  4. Print the final state of the vehicle.

**Part 3**
Details for Part 3 will be provided separately.

Stay tuned for updates and additional instructions as you progress through each part of the project. Feel free to reach out to your instructor for any clarifications or assistance.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
