# Compilers Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Compilers project, a practical exercise split into three parts designed for the 1st semester of the 2nd year of Computer Engineering. This project focuses on developing a set of regular expressions and finite automata to enable communication with an autonomous electric vehicle in the Compiling&Building factory.

## Part 1 - Practical Work

### Assignment Details:

- **Objective:**
  Develop a set of regular expressions and equivalent finite automata for a set of instructions used to communicate with the autonomous vehicle.

- **Instructions:**
  1. **MAINTENANCE(V):** Instructs the vehicle to go to the maintenance station.
  2. **CHARGE-BATTERY(V):** Instructs the vehicle to go to the charging station.
  3. **DELIVERY(L,M,Q):** Instructs the vehicle to make a delivery on an assembly line.
  4. **PICKUP(LIST):** Instructs the vehicle to pick up materials from the warehouse.
  5. **STATUS(I):** Instructs the vehicle to communicate its current state.

- **Submission:**
  - Groups of 3 members.
  - Each task has a score of 2 points.
  - Deadline: October 20, 2023, 11:59 PM (submitted as a single PDF on Moodle).
  - Demonstration and explanation to the Professor during PL classes in the week following the submission (5 minutes per group).
